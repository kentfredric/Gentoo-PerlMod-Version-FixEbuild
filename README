NAME
    Gentoo::PerlMod::Version::FixEbuild - Automatically fix an old-style
    ebuild to a new style ebuild.

VERSION
    version 0.1.0

SYNOPSIS
    This module is severely incomplete and only 'Just Works'.

    see the accompanying script for usage.

    This is currently my poorest quality module on CPAN, and this is just a
    release to get this horrible beast off my machine.

    The code is horrible, and far too complex for this and needs a serious
    overhaul. (yes, already, too much featureitis )

METHODS
  fix_file
        $instance->fix_file( @file_list )
        $instance->fix_file( $file );
        $instance->fix_file( \%config_overrides , @file_list );

    Fixes the given files.
